            <p>As a tundra dwarf, you are acclimated to the harsh realities of a cold world, both in temperature and in regards to isolation from others.  Generations spent steeping in mystical polar energies has granted your people an innate affinity for the arcane.  The arctic dwarves of Faerun are tundra dwarves, as are the Vrakar from the Icereach region in the Dragonlance setting</p>
